# Run Notebook on Your Local Machine

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/imsadia/cv-assignment-one.git
cd cv-assignment-one
```

Then download the required dataset from: \ 
`https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B1w1kGeu0GOZ_BpVnf-etb4WLb0q2-MF/view?usp=sharing`

After unzipping zip file of dataset, you just need to provide your path to the dataset folder in the following line of code in the Notebook: \
`for path in glob.glob("YOUR_PATH/000*/")`

Now your are good to go! :thumbsup::wink:
